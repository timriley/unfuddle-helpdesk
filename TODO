- show the created_at timestamp in the ticket show page.

- namespace the form params so we can do Comment.create(params[:comment])

- email notification when ticket is submitted

- redirect user straight to ticket's page when ticket is suvmitted?

- textilize the ticket bodies.

- load the tickets in the background via AJAX after initial page load to speed up the user experience

Maybe no:

- show the age of the oldest unassigned ticket (in relative time) on the front page

DONE

- display dates in "4 days ago" style

- unassigned tickets that are still within the 24 hour period should be a neutral color (grey?)
- only the unassigned tickets that are outside the 24 hour timeframe should be red

- try to use the real unfuddle reporter if there is no '--reported-->' string in the summary

- clean up the view for submitting tickets
 - need to allow select box for business area (component)
 - use cookies to remember name and component
 - use cookies for the flash[:notice] business
 
- html escape the data that is submitted in new ticket

- add a button to submit new tickets on the front page

- put a box around the ticket description when viewing a single ticket

- fix the "-1 days ago" prob

- fix the blank assignee prob

- show ticket comments in the view ticket page (& show how many comments there are per ticket in the index view)

- provide a way for people to submit comments for a ticket
  - comments will need to have the submitted name at the front of the body, separated by a delimiter, just like the tickets.
